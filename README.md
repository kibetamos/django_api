## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository:

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Depending on your operating system, activate the virtual environment:
    - For Unix/Linux:
        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - For Windows:

        ```
